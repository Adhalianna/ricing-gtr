mind the date, the procedures at https://console.developers.google.com/ might change

dependencies:
vdirsyncer
orage
a google account

Configure vdirsyncer:
create or copy to: ~/.config/vdirsyncer/config
	pay attention to pairing and collections! more info can be found inside vdirsyncer manual
	proposed setup: collections = ["yourmail@gmail.com"]
	this will sync with the default calendar
go to 'Orage calendar > File > Exchange files > Orage files' and change where orage calendar files are store to: ~/.config/orage/calendars/
Do the same for archive files (requires creating a file): ~/.config/orage/calendars/orage_archive.ics
enable CalDAV API for google calendar:
	go to: https://console.developers.google.com/
	create a new project
	go to library of APIs and find CalDAV API
	enable
	being on the page of CalDAV API look for "create creditentials" (dane logowania) and click
	make sure you  will be creating "OAuth" creditentials
	create for native/computer/pc application or sth like that, and choose any name for OAuth client
	congrats! you should have both client_id and client_secret available at the moment
run: vdirsyncer discover calendar
this will list available calendars on both sides and pair calendars specified in collections section of config file
run: vdirsyncer sync
a file with name "yourmail@gmail.com" should appear in ~/.config/orage/calendars/
go to 'Orage calendar > File > Exchange files > Foreign files', uncheck "Read only" and add the yourmail@gmail.com calendar from the directory
FINALLY: setup a serivce that periodically runs `vdirsyncer sync` and done! (can be done e.g. through cronie, available by default at Manjaro)
Sadly, you will need to always pay attention to which calendar you add through orage, it forces its default calendar on new file creation
