# ricing-gtr
An xfce + bspwm desktop (with two sessions to choose from) based on Manjaro xfce version for a particular person moving to linux who likes GT-R cars. 
The project focuses on workflow mostly and features some hacks for bspwm.

# Project goals
- make as many idiot proof comments in configs as possible
- make it comfortable to use
- design it for a laptop
- make it stable within Manjaro xfce
- make it look cool
- make it so good that Windows will be too painful to work with on daily basis

# To do
- improve keybindings
- create .local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/style.xml, a fitting theme for mousepad
- corrections to icons

# Nagging issues
- whisker-menu getting tiled
- neovim not launching from menu nor albert

# Useful hacks achevied so far
- dynamic bar behaviour of xfce4-bar (haven't seen anyone else doing this yet)
- conkies with desktop window type displayed properly in bspwm session
