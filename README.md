# ricing-gtr
An xfce + bspwm desktop (with two session to choose from) based on Manjaro xfce version for a particular person moving to linux who likes GT-R cars.

# Project goals
- make as many idiot proof comments in configs as possible
- make it comfortable to use
- design it for a laptop
- make it stable within Manjaro xfce
- make it look cool
- make it so good that Windows will be too painful to work with on daily basis

# Notes on packages
\+ sxhkd <br>
\+ bspwm <br>
\+ alacritty <br>
\+ albert <br>
\+ neovim <br>
\+ code-oss <br>
\+ compton (or rather picom but that is still the name of the package in manjaro repositories) <br>
\+ xdotool (an important dependecy for a fix that makes xfce4-panel dynamic in bspwm session, personal recommendation over xdo and wmctrl) <br>
\- light-locker (bug: impossible to type passwd after locking, might be worth adding after a fix)<br>
\- xfce4-appfinder <br>
\- emacs <br>


# Nagging issues
- window tearing with picom
- whisker-menu getting tiled
